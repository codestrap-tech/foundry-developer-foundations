Below is a sample prompt for creating a new factory based on factory.template.ts

Create a new factory using the template below that will:
Manage retrieval of templates based on file paths in the moduleRegistry. 
The factory should: 
1. First check for an exact match based on file path in moduleRegistry 
2. Then check if the path to the folder is in the moduleRegistry 
3. Load the file for the associated template using fs.promises as a string and return it 
Rename all the placeholder variables for moduleRegistry, SupportedModules, etc to something contextually relevant for a template factory. 
The ModuleInterface should also be renamed and have the property: template: string (path to the template to use)
